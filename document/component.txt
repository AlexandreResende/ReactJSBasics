We divide the content on a page into diffrent smaller components for easy of use and maintanibility

A componet contains function which returns JSX to us and we require it at the place where we want that to be 

The name of the componet should be capital first letter always because all html tags are small letter 

dividing wesites we create small components as header footer main body etc

Then we can combine these components into one 

The whole component should be enclosed in div tag 

A component can be combination of multiple react elements put together

Every componet should be put in seprate folder because every component has at least 2 files as .js and .css 

It's recomeended to make the file name and folder name capital as components should be capital

In every component file the first line import React from 'react'; is neccesary

Then we have to create a function may be arrao function the name should be capital letter first

Then inside the function create a variable the return it at the end of function 

At last export that function so that we can import this component into
